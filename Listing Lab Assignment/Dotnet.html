          .NET is a software framework that is designed and developed by
          Microsoft. The first version of the .Net framework was 1.0 which came
          in the year 2002. In easy words, it is a virtual machine for compiling
          and executing programs written in different languages like C#, VB.Net,
          etc.

        <h1>Main Components of .NET Framework</h1>
        <p>
          Common Language Runtime(CLR): CLR is the basic and Virtual Machine
          component of the .NET Framework. It is the run-time environment in the
          .NET Framework that runs the codes and helps in making the development
          process easier by providing various services such as remoting, thread
          management, type-safety, memory management, robustness, etc..
          Basically, it is responsible for managing the execution of .NET
          programs regardless of any .NET programming language. It also helps in
          the management of code, as code that targets the runtime is known as
          the Managed Code, and code that doesnâ€™t target to runtime is known as
          Unmanaged code.
